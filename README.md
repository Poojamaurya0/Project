# Background and Importance of Customer Service in Commercial Banking 
<br>
In today's dynamic financial environment, customer service is a critical 
factor that distinguishes one bank from another. 
<br>
As traditional banking products and services become increasingly standardized, the ability of a 
bank to attract, satisfy, and retain customers is heavily influenced by the 
quality of service it provides. 
<br>
Customer service in commercial banking 
encompasses all interactions between a bank and its customers, ranging 
from in-branch experiences to digital touchpoints, and it plays a pivotal role 
in shaping customer perceptions and loyalty.
